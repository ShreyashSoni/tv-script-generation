## tv-script-generation
### Generate a TV script using a Recurrent Neural Network.<br />
In this project, I've built a model that will generate its own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs.<br />
A part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons is used to train the network.<br /> 
The Neural Network will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.<br />
This project is done as the part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course of Udacity.

## Dependencies
The directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebook.<br />
To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
